## Welcome to the Unfair Advantage files. The world needs to know about something that no one talks about. That is the ICA's strong bias in favor of (*drum roll*) __Malaysian Chinese__.  All of the data has been extracted from a very reputable forum which has been the main source of tips for expats in Singapore for a very long time.

[1. Malaysian gets PR in 1 year](https://faceb0ok.github.io/unfairadvantage.io/Malaysian_gets_PR_in_1_year.html)
<br>
<br>
[2. Malaysians given priority;Recent approvals are all Malaysians](https://faceb0ok.github.io/unfairadvantage.io/Recent applications all Malaysians.html)
<br>
<br>
[3. Length of stay is 2 years in Singapore but wanna try to be PR. Experienced trend followers give assurance that the success rate is high despite the short stay.](https://faceb0ok.github.io/unfairadvantage.io/length of stay 2 years wanna apply Malaysian.html)

[4. Local dude 21 gets his 23 years old girlfriend, a Work Permit holder pregnant. Dude is relying on a few successful cases to get green light for his case. Will there be higher chances if the impregnator and the impregnated were non Chinese? Why does he sound so confident? Ministry of Manpower clearly states that a Work Permit holder cannot marry a Singaporean. Different race, different law?](https://faceb0ok.github.io/unfairadvantage.io/local dude gets WP holder Malaysian pregnant.html)

[5. There is this thing called 'OTHERS' category which bluntly means any nationality/race other than Malaysian Chinese. This is not shown openly on the ICA website.  ](https://faceb0ok.github.io/unfairadvantage.io/Others Category which is Hidden.html)
<br>
<br>
[6. The "problem" is you are not pure Chinese blood family. That's all. That means you get put into the others category which has an extremely limited number of yearly approvals. Honestly I don't think the debt issue has anything to do with it.

Divorce your wife, wait a year or two and then remarry w pure Chinese woman (she must have Chinese name and ancestry) and apply again (if PR is that important).
